# Better stats for StackOverflow 2023's survey

The [2023 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-admired-and-desired) of Stackoverflow is incredible, though it is not possible to sort technologies by the most `Admired` one, nor by the average between `Desired` and `Admired`, nor by the largest width between `Desired` and `Admired`.

> It's to browse those statistic that I built this simple Svelte display.

The raw results are displayed in JSON at the bottom of the web page.
